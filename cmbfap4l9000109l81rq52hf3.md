Struggling to pinpoint the right data or make sense of messy query results? Welcome to our beginner-friendly SQL series, where we‚Äôre mastering essential SQL skills with [Oracle‚Äôs LiveSQL](https://livesql.oracle.com/)‚Äîa free, zero-setup browser-based platform for instant SQL practice! Today, we‚Äôre tackling filtering with WHERE and sorting with ORDER BY to make your queries laser-focused and organized. Let‚Äôs dive in! ü§©ü§∫ü•≥

## Why WHERE and ORDER BY Are Game-Changers

As a new SQL learner, you want data that answers your questions. The `WHERE` clause filters rows (e.g., ‚ÄúShow only recent hires‚Äù). The `ORDER BY` clause sorts results (e.g., ‚ÄúList jobs by start date‚Äù). Together, they‚Äôre your tools for clean, meaningful data‚Äîperfect for any SQL lover!

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll:

* Filter data with `WHERE` using conditions like equals or greater than.
    
* Sort results with `ORDER BY`, including handling nulls.
    
* Leverage LiveSQL‚Äôs auto-complete, error highlighting, Quick SQL, and Library scripts to experiment!!
    

## Step 1: Jump into LiveSQL

Visit [livesql.oracle.com](https://livesql.oracle.com/next), sign in, and you‚Äôre dropped straight into the SQL Worksheet. We‚Äôre going to be using the HR schema‚Äôs `JOB_HISTORY` table (columns: `employee_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `job_id`) for fresh examples, different from `SCOTT` in my video above. [See setup details](https://www.lay.codes/blog/mastering-sql-joins-with-zero-database-setup).

## Step 2: Filtering with WHERE

`WHERE` lets you pick rows matching specific conditions. The `WHERE` clause is used to specify a certain condition while fetching or modifying data in a database!

### *Example 1: Basic Filtering*

Find job changes after 2000:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, start_date, job_id
FROM job_history
WHERE start_date > TO_DATE('2000-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD');
```

Auto-complete suggests `TO_DATE`:

Run the query, and you‚Äôll see LiveSQL‚Äôs error highlighting in action! The error is because LiveSQL needs the schema name (`HR.`) to find the table `job_history`‚Äîit should be `HR.job_history`. Error highlighting flags this mistake, helping you learn fast!

Let‚Äôs fix it:

### *Example 2: Multiple Conditions*

Find job changes for `employee 101` with a specific job ID:

```sql
SELECT start_date, job_id
FROM HR.job_history
WHERE employee_id = 101 AND job_id = 'AC_ACCOUNT';
```

Query results:

**Tips for WHERE**

* Use =, &gt;, &lt;, !=, LIKE (e.g., `job_id LIKE 'SA%'`).
    
* Text needs single quotes (e.g., `'AC_ACCOUNT'`).
    

### *Example 3: Using IN for Multiple Values*

Need to filter for several employees? Use `IN` to list their IDs:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, start_date, job_id
FROM HR.job_history
WHERE employee_id IN (100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105);
```

This shows job history for employees with IDs *100 to 105*‚Äîsuper handy for filtering multiple values at once!

## Step 3: Sorting with ORDER BY

`ORDER BY` organizes results with `ASC` or `DESC`. `ASC` and `DESC` determines that the values in the specified column should be sorted in *ascending* or *descending* order. `ASC` sorts from the *lowest* value to *highest* value. `DESC` sorts from *highest* value to *lowest* value. `ASC` is the **default** sort order.

**Tips for ORDER BY**

* `ASC` is default.
    
* Use `NULLS FIRST/LAST` for nulls.
    

### *Example 1: Simple Sorting*

Sort job history by `start_date` (newest first):

```sql
SELECT employee_id, start_date
FROM HR.job_history
ORDER BY start_date DESC;
```

The query results show us an employee‚Äôs start date in *descending (DESC)* order, from most recent start date to oldest:

### *Example 2: Handling Nulls*

Sort by `end_date`, nulls last:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, end_date
FROM HR.job_history
ORDER BY end_date DESC NULLS LAST;
```

Try `NULLS FIRST` to compare!

### *Example 3: Stretch Goal‚ÄîCustom Sorting*

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre making a report and want to spotlight all `'IT_PROG'` jobs first, then list other jobs, all sorted by start date. This query does just that:

```sql
SELECT job_id, start_date
FROM HR.job_history
ORDER BY CASE WHEN job_id = 'IT_PROG' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END, start_date;
```

Query results prioritize the `‚ÄòIT_PROG‚Äô` jobs first:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1748620734403/c7fb38ac-c37b-431d-951b-25ea70197cd9.png align="center")

Here‚Äôs the query breakdown: The `CASE` trick checks if job\_id is `'IT_PROG'`. If it is, it gives those rows a `1` (top priority); all other jobs get a `2`. So, `IT_PROG` jobs come first! Then, within each group, `start_date` sorts them from earliest to latest. It‚Äôs like saying, *‚ÄúShow me IT programmers first, then everyone else, all in date order.‚Äù* Pretty cool, right? ü§†

Try tweaking the query for fun‚Äîmaybe prioritize `'SA_REP'` instead!

## Step 4: Combine WHERE and ORDER BY

Find job changes *after* 1998 for job ID `‚ÄòSA_REP‚Äô`, sorted by the job ID‚Äôs start date:

```sql
SELECT start_date, job_id
FROM HR.job_history
WHERE start_date > TO_DATE('1998-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
  AND job_id = 'SA_REP'
ORDER BY start_date DESC;
```

Query results:

## Step 5: Save and Explore More

**Save your work:**

1. Click ‚Äú*Save*‚Äù in LiveSQL.
    
2. Name it (e.g., ‚Äú*filter\_sort.sql*‚Äù) and download.
    
3. Try *Run Script* (F5) to execute multiple queries from your .sql file!
    

Explore Library Sample Scripts‚Äîsearch ‚Äú`WHERE`‚Äù to load pre-built queries and tweak them. Check session history to revisit experiments or Explain Plan for performance insights.

## Practice Makes Perfect

Try these challenges:

1. Filter job\_id starting with `‚ÄòAD‚Äô` and sort by `end_date` (nulls first).
    
2. Find job changes before 1999, sorted by `employee_id`.
