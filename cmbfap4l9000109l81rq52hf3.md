Struggling to pinpoint the right data or make sense of messy query results? Welcome to our beginner-friendly SQL series, where we’re mastering essential SQL skills with [Oracle’s LiveSQL](https://livesql.oracle.com/)—a free, zero-setup browser-based platform for instant SQL practice! Today, we’re tackling filtering with WHERE and sorting with ORDER BY to make your queries laser-focused and organized. Let’s dive in! 🤩🤺🥳

## Why WHERE and ORDER BY Are Game-Changers

As a new SQL learner, you want data that answers your questions. The `WHERE` clause filters rows (e.g., “Show only recent hires”). The `ORDER BY` clause sorts results (e.g., “List jobs by start date”). Together, they’re your tools for clean, meaningful data—perfect for any SQL lover!

In this tutorial, we’ll:

* Filter data with `WHERE` using conditions like equals or greater than.
    
* Sort results with `ORDER BY`, including handling nulls.
    
* Leverage LiveSQL’s auto-complete, error highlighting, Quick SQL, and Library scripts to experiment!!
    

## Step 1: Jump into LiveSQL

New to LiveSQL? Visit [livesql.oracle.com](https://livesql.oracle.com/next), sign in, and open the SQL Worksheet. Auto-complete suggests columns and keywords, and error highlighting catches typos, making `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` a breeze! Use Navigator’s DDL Tab to check table structures (e.g., JOB\_HISTORY’s `start_date` is a date). We’re using the HR schema’s `JOB_HISTORY` table (columns: `employee_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `job_id`) for fresh examples, different from `SCOTT` in our joins post. [See setup details](https://www.lay.codes/blog/mastering-sql-joins-with-zero-database-setup).

## Step 2: Filtering with WHERE

`WHERE` lets you pick rows matching specific conditions. The `WHERE` clause is used to specify a certain condition while fetching or modifying data in a database!

### *Example 1: Basic Filtering*

Find job changes after 2000:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, start_date, job_id
FROM job_history
WHERE start_date > TO_DATE('2000-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD');
```

Auto-complete suggests `TO_DATE`:

Run the query, and you’ll see LiveSQL’s error highlighting in action! The error is because LiveSQL needs the schema name (`HR.`) to find the table `job_history`—it should be `HR.job_history`. Error highlighting flags this mistake, helping you learn fast!

Let’s fix it:

### *Example 2: Multiple Conditions*

Find job changes for `employee 101` with a specific job ID:

```sql
SELECT start_date, job_id
FROM HR.job_history
WHERE employee_id = 101 AND job_id = 'AC_ACCOUNT';
```

Query results:

**Tips for WHERE**

* Use =, &gt;, &lt;, !=, LIKE (e.g., `job_id LIKE 'SA%'`).
    
* Text needs single quotes (e.g., `'AC_ACCOUNT'`).
    

## Step 3: Sorting with ORDER BY

`ORDER BY` organizes results with `ASC` or `DESC`. `ASC` and `DESC` determines that the values in the specified column should be sorted in *ascending* or *descending* order. `ASC` sorts from the *lowest* value to *highest* value. `DESC` sorts from *highest* value to *lowest* value. `ASC` is the **default** sort order.

**Tips for ORDER BY**

* `ASC` is default.
    
* Use `NULLS FIRST/LAST` for nulls.
    

### *Example 1: Simple Sorting*

Sort job history by `start_date` (newest first):

```sql
SELECT employee_id, start_date
FROM HR.job_history
ORDER BY start_date DESC;
```

The query results show us an employee’s start date in *descending (DESC)* order, from most recent start date to oldest:

### *Example 2: Handling Nulls*

Sort by `end_date`, nulls last:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, end_date
FROM HR.job_history
ORDER BY end_date DESC NULLS LAST;
```

Try `NULLS FIRST` to compare!

### *Example 3: Stretch Goal—Custom Sorting*

Let’s say you’re making a report and want to spotlight all `'IT_PROG'` jobs first, then list other jobs, all sorted by start date. This query does just that:

```sql
SELECT job_id, start_date
FROM HR.job_history
ORDER BY CASE WHEN job_id = 'IT_PROG' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END, start_date;
```

Query results prioritize the `‘IT_PROG’` jobs first:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1748620734403/c7fb38ac-c37b-431d-951b-25ea70197cd9.png align="center")

Here’s the query breakdown: The `CASE` trick checks if job\_id is `'IT_PROG'`. If it is, it gives those rows a `1` (top priority); all other jobs get a `2`. So, `IT_PROG` jobs come first! Then, within each group, `start_date` sorts them from earliest to latest. It’s like saying, *“Show me IT programmers first, then everyone else, all in date order.”* Pretty cool, right? 🤠

Try tweaking the query for fun—maybe prioritize `'SA_REP'` instead!

## Step 4: Combine WHERE and ORDER BY

Find job changes *after* 1998 for job ID `‘SA_REP’`, sorted by the job ID’s start date:

```sql
SELECT start_date, job_id
FROM HR.job_history
WHERE start_date > TO_DATE('1998-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD')
  AND job_id = 'SA_REP'
ORDER BY start_date DESC;
```

Query results:

## Step 5: Create Custom Data with Quick SQL

**You’ll have to log into your LiveSQL account for this step.** But, try Quick SQL to create your own data for practice! Let’s switch to a QuickSQL worksheet, here’s how:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1748621822060/94309339-6851-4e92-bc57-0486b88ca88b.gif align="center")

Now that you’re signed in and in the QuickSQL worksheet, let’s write some QuickSQL! 😝

Here’s a query for creating your own QuickSQL table:

```sql
sales /insert 5
  region
  amount /values 100, 300, 500, 700, 900
```

What this QuickSQL query does:

* * `sales /insert 5`: Creates the sales table with 5 rows
        
    * `region`: Defaults to `varchar2(4000)`
        
    * `amount /values 100, 300, 500, 700, 900`: Specifies possible values for amount, ensuring some rows have `amount > 500` (e.g., 700, 900). Quick SQL will randomly assign these values to the 5 rows
        
    * Quick SQL auto-generates an id column as the primary key
        

Press `Control + Enter` to run the query, or use the button shown below in the Worksheet:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1748874525267/07ed1b33-4046-42ab-bf4c-e98743a44a74.gif align="center")

Now, let’s switch back to a PL/SQL worksheet and check out our new table created by QuickSQL:

```sql
SELECT region, amount
FROM sales
WHERE amount > 500
ORDER BY amount DESC;
```

Switch back to a PL/SQL worksheet like so:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1748875786309/b5a77511-24cd-4a50-b605-d852ea4afa7c.gif align="center")

* And boom! That’s *filtering* (`amount > 500`) and *sorting* (`ORDER BY amount DESC`) data in action 🔥🔥
    

## Step 6: Save and Explore More

**Save your work:**

1. Click “*Save*” in LiveSQL.
    
2. Name it (e.g., “*filter\_sort.sql*”) and download.
    
3. Try *Run Script* (F5) to execute multiple queries from your .sql file!
    

Explore Library Sample Scripts—search “`WHERE`” to load pre-built queries and tweak them. Check session history to revisit experiments or Explain Plan for performance insights.

## Practice Makes Perfect

Try these challenges:

1. Filter job\_id starting with `‘AD’` and sort by `end_date` (nulls first).
    
2. Find job changes before 1999, sorted by `employee_id`.
