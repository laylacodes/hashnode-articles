Howdy SQL enthusiast! If you‚Äôre diving into SQL and tackling joins‚Äîa *key* concept for combining data from multiple tables‚Äî [***LiveSQL***](https://livesql.oracle.com/next/) is your *free*, *browser-based playground* to make learning a breeze üî• It‚Äôs built on Oracle Database, which means: *no downloads, no installs*, just pure SQL practice. In this post, we‚Äôll walk you through using LiveSQL to master joins with hands-on examples to show you exactly how it works. Let‚Äôs get started!!

## Why Joins Matter

Joins let you pull data from multiple tables based on a shared column‚Äîlike matching customer orders to customer names. If you‚Äôre in a database class or following along an online course, you‚Äôre probably seeing joins early on. LiveSQL makes practicing joins (or any other database programming concept) intuitive, with pre-loaded datasets and a clean interface to run queries and see results *instantly*! üòä

## Step 1: Jump into LiveSQL (No Account Needed)

Head to [livesql.oracle.com/next](https://livesql.oracle.com/next/) and you‚Äôre immediately dropped into LiveSQL‚Äôs Worksheet, where the magic happens‚Äîno signup required to start querying! ü•≥

On the *left*, the **Navigator Panel** shows pre-loaded tables you can experiment with, like *EMP* (employees) and *DEPT* (departments). These are perfect for practicing joins. In the center, the **Worksheet** is where you‚Äôll write your SQL. Below it, the **Query Result Panel** shows your output. Here‚Äôs the interface:

## Step 2: Write Your First Join Query

Let‚Äôs try an *INNER JOIN* to combine employee names from the *EMP* table with their department names from the *DEPT* table. The shared column? *DEPTNO* (department number).

In the Worksheet, type this query:

```sql
SELECT e.ENAME, d.DNAME
FROM SCOTT.EMP e
INNER JOIN SCOTT.DEPT d
ON e.DEPTNO = d.DEPTNO;
```

Hit the *Run* button (or press Ctrl+Enter). *Boom*‚Äîyour results appear in the Query Result Panel, showing employee names alongside their department names:

*What‚Äôs happening here?* The *INNER JOIN* grabs only the rows where *DEPTNO* matches in both tables. Notice how LiveSQL‚Äôs interface makes it easy to write, run, and check your output without any setup ü•∞

## Step 3: Experiment with Different Joins

Joins come in flavors like *LEFT JOIN*, *RIGHT JOIN*, and *FULL JOIN*, each handling unmatched rows differently üî• Let‚Äôs try a *LEFT JOIN* to include all employees, even if they don‚Äôt have a department:

```sql
SELECT e.ENAME, d.DNAME
FROM SCOTT.EMP e
LEFT JOIN SCOTT.DEPT d
ON e.DEPTNO = d.DEPTNO;
```

Run it, and you‚Äôll see all employees, with *NULL* for any missing department names. LiveSQL‚Äôs Query Result Panel clearly displays the output, and you can toggle to the Explain Plan tab to see how the query works under the hood. Here‚Äôs the query results:

And here‚Äôs how you can check out your query‚Äôs Explain plan:

## Step 4: Save Your Work (Optional Free Account)

Love your query? Save it as a `.sql` file to your device via the Worksheet‚Äôs *Save* button, or store it in your *browser‚Äôs local storage* to have for next time you visit LiveSQL.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1745354895018/d877b023-9438-4d49-b737-00c711cabe3d.gif align="center")

**Want to create your own tables or save queries to your LiveSQL account?** Sign up for a free Oracle account in 2 minutes:

1. Click Sign In (*top righ*t).
    
2. Hit *Create an Account*, enter your email/name/password, and verify via email.
    
3. Sign in, and you‚Äôll get your own schema to build your own tables and save your work!
    

With an account, you can also favorite tutorials in LiveSQL‚Äôs Library (more on that next).

## Step 5: Level Up with LiveSQL‚Äôs Library

LiveSQL‚Äôs *Library* tab is packed with tutorials to deepen your joins knowledge. Click *Library* on the homepage, search for ‚Äú*joins*,‚Äù and pick a tutorial like ‚Äú*Joining Tables.*‚Äù Each tutorial walks you through steps with sample queries you can run directly in the Worksheet.

***Note****: To create or modify tables in tutorials (e.g., inserting data, dropping tables, etc), you‚Äôll need that free account!* ü§†

## Step 6: Break It, Learn It, Ask for Help

LiveSQL‚Äôs Worksheet is a safe sandbox‚Äîexperiment without fear, friends ü´£ try tweaking your join queries (e.g., change *INNER* to *FULL* or mess with the *ON* clause) to see what happens. Stuck? Reach out:
